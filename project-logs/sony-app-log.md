# Project #1

I'm going to make the app for Sony cameras. All the other apps in the app store suck and it will be much more convenient for myself to use an app instead of transferring photos via a cable.

Since I have absolutely no idea where to start, I've asked ChatGPT where to start. I'm not sure if this is frowned upon or not.

#### Day 1: _9/18/2024_

This is the start date of my project. I think for now, I'm going to do a YouTube tutorial on how to use React Native. -- Gonna go to bed soon, I can't figure out how to get the QR code to load in my terminal and the Metro Bundler isn't showing up at the server it tells me. Basically, day 1 was a fail, but I got started.
