# Project Ideas
### Topics I'm Interested In
* Fantasy football
  * ML best lineup predictions and drafting? Could create a large dataset with values representing QB situation, target share, weapon competition, etc., then calculate a score to rank the player and use that ranking. Probably have to take injuries into account, too
* NFL
* CFB? 
  * Maybe something for scouting / evaluating players in CFB
* NBA
* Anime
  * Anime recommender. Input your favorite animes, runs an algorithm to figure out which other animes you might like. Could work with a graph in this to show relationships between similar animes
* Photography 
  * Upload photos from Sony to phone thru an app (all the other ones suck) 
* Music / Music production
  * Music social media
* Gym
  * ML to create best splits and workouts for given situation?
